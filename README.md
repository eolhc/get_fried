## Why

Tic Tac Toe is not intuitively the most fun game, however, General Assembly assigned us to replicate it anyway as our first project.

## What's Different

Turn your volume up and sing as Drake or Kanye while making your move. An infinitesimally harder challenge is to get your rapper to rhythmically grunt in time with the background music. What you can't see as well, is that there's a win checking algorithm in place, because who wants to just match arrays! What if you had massively sized boards?! How do you scale win checking then?! Not by matching arrays.

## What I Learned

Put your players first! It doesn't matter that you can choose to play on a 5x5 board or 9x9 board. The implementation of the win check algorithm was shockingly underwhelming. The larger the board, the longer it takes to win, and the more futile and boring it is. So I learned that I need to plan a bit more and to plan for the user too. Also, I learned that I needed to use lower resolution cat images.

## Where This Could Go

It could have a cleaner look. Let's be honest. Really could look better. Also now that I have useless larger boards at my disposal, I might as well do something with them. Like plant explosives on random squares so that there's more excitement! Or I'll hide treasure! Players surely will like finding treasure. Maybe the treasure will change your play! Maybe it'll award you with additional adjacent squares. Maybe you will start to sing differently and not be limited to the one type of grunt. Who knows.
